# Interactive User Registration Form

## Objectives

### By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

[✅] Structure an HTML form with appropriate input fields for registration.<br>
[✅] Implement real-time input validation using JavaScript event listeners (input event).<br>
[✅] Use HTML5 validation attributes (e.g., required, type, minlength, pattern).<br>
[✅] Apply the JavaScript Constraint Validation API to check validity and display custom error messages.<br>
[✅] Dynamically create and display error messages next to input fields.<br>
[✅] Handle the form submit event, prevent default submission, and perform final validation.<br>
[✅] Use localStorage to save and retrieve simple form data (e.g., username).<br>

## Reflection Questions

### Include your answers to the following questions in your submission, within the README.md file:

### How did event.preventDefault() help in handling form submission?

### What is the difference between using HTML5 validation attributes and JavaScript-based validation? Why might you use both?

### Explain how you used localStorage to persist and retrieve the username. What are the limitations of localStorage for storing sensitive data?

### Describe a challenge you faced in implementing the real-time validation and how you solved it.

### How did you ensure that custom error messages were user-friendly and displayed at the appropriate times?
